    <h1>Analysis of Momentum Transfer in a Baseball Bat-Ball Collision</h1>

    <p>
        In this analysis, we consider the mechanics of hitting a baseball with a bat in terms of momentum transfer. When a bat hits the ball, 
        there is an interaction that changes the momentum of both the bat and the ball, resulting in the ball being propelled away from the 
        bat at high speed. To study this, we examine the principle of conservation of momentum, as well as vector decomposition of forces and velocities.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
        A baseball bat of mass \( M \) and initial velocity \( \vec{V}_{\text{bat}} \) collides with a baseball of mass \( m \) and initial velocity 
        \( \vec{V}_{\text{ball}} \). After the collision, the ball is propelled in the direction opposite to its initial path, while the bat continues 
        with a reduced velocity. The analysis seeks to determine:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The final velocity \( \vec{V}'_{\text{bat}} \) of the bat after the collision.</li>
        <li>The final velocity \( \vec{V}'_{\text{ball}} \) of the ball.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We will assume a perfectly elastic collision (no energy loss) to simplify calculations, though in real scenarios, some energy would be 
        dissipated as heat or sound.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Assumptions and Given Quantities</h2>
    <p>
        Let the initial conditions be defined as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mass of the bat: \( M \)</li>
        <li>Initial velocity of the bat: \( \vec{V}_{\text{bat}} = V_{\text{bat}} \hat{i} \)</li>
        <li>Mass of the ball: \( m \)</li>
        <li>Initial velocity of the ball: \( \vec{V}_{\text{ball}} = -V_{\text{ball}} \hat{i} \)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Here, we use the \( \hat{i} \) and \( \hat{j} \) unit vectors for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Conservation of Momentum</h2>
    <p>
        In an isolated system, the total linear momentum before and after the collision remains constant. Thus,
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        \text{Total Initial Momentum} = \text{Total Final Momentum}
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        Expressed in equation form:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        M \vec{V}_{\text{bat}} + m \vec{V}_{\text{ball}} = M \vec{V}'_{\text{bat}} + m \vec{V}'_{\text{ball}}
        \]
    </p>

    <h2>4. Solving for Final Velocities</h2>
    <p>
        Assuming an elastic collision, kinetic energy is also conserved:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        \frac{1}{2} M V_{\text{bat}}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m V_{\text{ball}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} M {V'_{\text{bat}}}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m {V'_{\text{ball}}}^2
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        These two equations (momentum and energy conservation) allow us to solve for \( V'_{\text{bat}} \) and \( V'_{\text{ball}} \). By rearranging and simplifying, 
        we obtain the final velocities for a one-dimensional elastic collision:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        V'_{\text{bat}} = \frac{(M - m)V_{\text{bat}} + 2m V_{\text{ball}}}{M + m}
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        V'_{\text{ball}} = \frac{(m - M)V_{\text{ball}} + 2M V_{\text{bat}}}{M + m}
        \]
    </p>

    <h2>5. Vector Decomposition</h2>
    <p>
        If the collision is not head-on but occurs at an angle, we can decompose the velocities into x- and y-components. Assuming 
        that the initial velocity of the ball makes an angle \( \theta \) with the bat's path, we can define:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial velocity of the ball along the x-axis: \( V_{\text{ball,x}} = V_{\text{ball}} \cos \theta \)</li>
        <li>Initial velocity of the ball along the y-axis: \( V_{\text{ball,y}} = V_{\text{ball}} \sin \theta \)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The same momentum conservation principles apply separately to the x- and y-components:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>In the x-direction:</b>
        \[
        M V_{\text{bat}} + m V_{\text{ball,x}} = M V'_{\text{bat,x}} + m V'_{\text{ball,x}}
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>In the y-direction:</b>
        \[
        0 + m V_{\text{ball,y}} = M V'_{\text{bat,y}} + m V'_{\text{ball,y}}
        \]
    </p>

    <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        This analysis demonstrates that the post-collision velocities depend on both the masses and initial velocities of the bat and the ball, as well as the 
        angle of impact. Vector decomposition is essential for analyzing collisions that are not along a single line, allowing us to study the outcomes in 
        both the x- and y-directions independently.
    </p>
    <p>
        By conserving both momentum and kinetic energy, we arrive at the final velocities in each direction, providing insight into how forces are 
        transmitted and absorbed during a high-speed collision such as hitting a baseball.
