    <h2>Seating Arrangements in a School Bus</h2>

    <p>
        The number of ways students can be seated in a school bus depends on several factors:
        <ul>
            <li>The number of seats \(n\) in the bus</li>
            <li>The number of students \(r\)</li>
            <li>Whether the order of seating matters (permutation) or not (combination)</li>
            <li>Whether there are more students than seats or vice versa</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Case 1: Exactly as many students as seats (\(n = r\))</h3>
    <p>
        Let’s assume there are 10 students and 10 seats. The task is to find the number of ways the students can be seated.
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        Since there are exactly as many students as seats, we use the permutation formula:
        \[
        P(n, r) = r! = 10!
        \]
        Calculating \(10!\):
        \[
        10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 3,628,800
        \]
        Therefore, the students can be seated in <b>3,628,800</b> ways.
    </div>

    <h3>Case 2: More seats than students (\(n > r\))</h3>
    <p>
        Let’s assume there are 15 seats and 10 students. We want to find the number of ways to seat 10 students in 15 seats.
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        We use the permutation formula:
        \[
        P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}
        \]
        For \(n = 15\) seats and \(r = 10\) students:
        \[
        P(15, 10) = \frac{15!}{(15 - 10)!} = \frac{15!}{5!}
        \]
        Let's calculate this:
        \[
        15! = 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6
        \]
        \[
        5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
        \]
        So:
        \[
        P(15, 10) = \frac{15!}{5!} = \frac{15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{120}
        \]
        This equals:
        \[
        P(15, 10) = 1,816,214,400
        \]
        Therefore, there are <b>1,816,214,400</b> ways to seat 10 students in 15 seats.
    </div>

    <h3>Case 3: More students than seats (\(n < r\))</h3>
    <p>
        Let’s assume there are 8 seats and 10 students. We need to choose 8 students from 10 and then arrange them in the seats.
    </p>
    <div class="solution">
        This is a two-step process:
        <ol>
            <li>First, choose which 8 students will sit from the 10. This is a combination:
                \[
                \binom{r}{n} = \binom{10}{8} = \frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!} = \frac{10!}{8!2!}
                \]
                Simplifying:
                \[
                \binom{10}{8} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = 45
                \]
            </li>
            <li>Now arrange the chosen 8 students in the 8 seats, which is:
                \[
                8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40,320
                \]
            </li>
        </ol>
        Therefore, the total number of seating arrangements is:
        \[
        \text{Total ways} = 45 \times 8! = 45 \times 40,320 = 1,814,400
        \]
        So, there are <b>1,814,400</b> ways to seat 8 students chosen from 10.
