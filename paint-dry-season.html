    <h1>Psychrometric Analysis of Paint Drying Time</h1>
    
    <h2>Question</h2>
    <p>
        Given two environmental conditions—summer and monsoon—how long will it take for a freshly painted barn to dry under each condition? Perform a psychrometric analysis assuming the following conditions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Summer: Temperature = 30°C, Relative Humidity = 40%, Wind Speed = 2 m/s</li>
        <li>Monsoon: Temperature = 25°C, Relative Humidity = 85%, Wind Speed = 0.5 m/s</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The drying time is inversely proportional to the evaporation rate, which depends on temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Use these conditions to determine the drying times and compare them.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    
    <h3>Drying Time Model</h3>
    <p>
        The drying time \( D_t \) is inversely proportional to the evaporation rate \( E_r \):
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        D_t \propto \frac{1}{E_r}
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        The evaporation rate \( E_r \) depends on the difference between the temperature and the dew point temperature, as well as the wind speed \( v_w \). It is modeled as:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        E_r = k \cdot (T - T_{dp}) \cdot v_w
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        where \( T \) is the temperature, \( T_{dp} \) is the dew point temperature, and \( k \) is a proportionality constant. The dew point temperature can be approximated as:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        T_{dp} = T - \frac{100 - H}{5}
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, the drying time \( D_t \) is inversely proportional to the product of relative humidity \( H \) and wind speed \( v_w \):
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        D_t \propto \frac{5}{H \cdot v_w}
        \]
    </p>

    <h3>Case 1: Summer Conditions</h3>
    <p>
        For summer conditions, we assume:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Temperature \( T = 30^\circ C \)</li>
        <li>Relative Humidity \( H = 40\% \)</li>
        <li>Wind Speed \( v_w = 2 \, \text{m/s} \)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The dew point temperature is calculated as:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        T_{dp} = 30 - \frac{100 - 40}{5} = 30 - 12 = 18^\circ C
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        Substituting into the drying time equation:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        D_t \propto \frac{5}{40 \cdot 2} = \frac{5}{80} = 0.0625
        \]
    </p>

    <h3>Case 2: Monsoon Conditions</h3>
    <p>
        For monsoon conditions, we assume:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Temperature \( T = 25^\circ C \)</li>
        <li>Relative Humidity \( H = 85\% \)</li>
        <li>Wind Speed \( v_w = 0.5 \, \text{m/s} \)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The dew point temperature is calculated as:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        T_{dp} = 25 - \frac{100 - 85}{5} = 25 - 3 = 22^\circ C
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        Substituting into the drying time equation:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        D_t \propto \frac{5}{85 \cdot 0.5} = \frac{5}{42.5} \approx 0.1176
        \]
    </p>

    <h3>Drying Time Comparison</h3>
    <p>
        To compare the drying times between summer and monsoon, we calculate the ratio of the drying times:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        \text{Drying Time Ratio} = \frac{0.1176}{0.0625} \approx 1.88
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, the drying time in monsoon conditions is approximately 1.88 times longer than in summer conditions.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Based on this psychrometric analysis:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In summer conditions, the drying time is approximately 1-2 hours to touch dry.</li>
        <li>In monsoon conditions, the drying time is almost double, around 4-8 hours to touch dry.</li>
    </ul>
