<h1>Calculating the Pressure Exerted by Stilettos</h1>

<p>To calculate the pressure exerted by the stilettos worn by a woman while walking, we need to use the formula for pressure:</p>

$$
P = \frac{F}{A}
$$

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>P</b> is the pressure exerted (in Pascals, Pa)</li>
    <li><b>F</b> is the force exerted, which is the weight of the person (in Newtons, N)</li>
    <li><b>A</b> is the area of contact of the heel with the ground (in square meters, m²)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Calculate the Force (Weight)</h2>
<p>Assume an average weight for a woman to be approximately <b>70 kg</b>. The force exerted due to gravity can be calculated using the formula:</p>

$$
F = m \cdot g
$$

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>m</b> is the mass of the woman (in kilograms, kg)</li>
    <li><b>g</b> is the acceleration due to gravity, approximately <b>9.8 m/s²</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Substituting values:</p>

$$
F = 70 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 686 \, \text{N}
$$

<h2>Step 2: Estimate the Area of Contact</h2>
<p>The contact area of a stiletto heel is typically quite small. For a common stiletto heel, the area is about <b>1 cm²</b>, which we need to convert to square meters:</p>

$$
A = 1 \, \text{cm}^2 = 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2
$$

<h2>Step 3: Calculate the Pressure</h2>
<p>Using the formula for pressure, we can now substitute the values of <i>F</i> and <i>A</i>:</p>

$$
P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{686 \, \text{N}}{1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2}
$$

<p>Calculating this gives:</p>

$$
P = 6,860,000 \, \text{Pa} \quad \text{or} \quad 6.86 \, \text{MPa}
$$

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The pressure exerted by the stilettos on the ground is approximately <b>6.86 MPa</b>. This high pressure is why stilettos can easily damage soft surfaces like wood or carpet, as the force is concentrated over a very small area.</p>
