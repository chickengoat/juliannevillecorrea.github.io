<h1>Height-Pressure Relationship in a Floating Cover Biogas Digester</h1>

<p>A floating cover biogas digester consists of a chamber where biogas accumulates, causing a floating cover to rise. As the gas builds up, the pressure inside the chamber increases, causing a change in the height of the floating cover.</p>

<h2>Problem Formulation</h2>

<p>Given:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Initial pressure in the chamber, \( P_0 \) (e.g., atmospheric pressure).</li>
    <li>Variable pressure in the chamber as gas is produced, \( P \).</li>
    <li>Cross-sectional area of the chamber, \( A \), assumed constant.</li>
    <li>Height of the floating cover at any pressure \( P \), \( h(P) \).</li>
</ul>

<p>We need to derive an equation that gives \( h(P) \) as a function of \( P \).</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Assuming an ideal gas behavior, we can relate pressure \( P \), volume \( V \), and height \( h \) as follows.</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$ V = A \cdot h(P) $$
</div>

<p>According to Boyle's Law, since temperature is constant:</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$ P_0 V_0 = P \cdot V $$
</div>

<p>where \( V_0 \) is the initial volume and \( P_0 \) is the initial pressure. Since \( V = A \cdot h(P) \) and \( V_0 = A \cdot h_0 \), where \( h_0 \) is the initial height:</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$ P_0 \cdot A \cdot h_0 = P \cdot A \cdot h(P) $$
</div>

<p>Dividing both sides by \( A \) and solving for \( h(P) \):</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$ h(P) = \frac{P_0 \cdot h_0}{P} $$
</div>

<p>Thus, the height \( h(P) \) varies inversely with the pressure \( P \), indicating that as pressure increases, the floating cover height decreases according to the relationship above.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This inverse relationship between height and pressure in a floating cover biogas digester ensures that the digester maintains consistent pressure regulation as biogas production varies.</p>
