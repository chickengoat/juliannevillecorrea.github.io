<h1>Cruise Ship Displacement and Evacuation Time Estimation</h1>

<h2>1. Displacement Calculation</h2>
<p>To keep the cruise ship afloat, the weight of the water displaced by the ship must be equal to the weight of the ship itself. This follows from <em>Archimedes' principle</em>:</p>

<p>The weight of the ship is given as:</p>
$$
\text{Weight of the ship} = 200,000 \, \text{tons} = 200,000 \times 1,000 \, \text{kg} = 200,000,000 \, \text{kg}
$$

<p>To stay afloat, the ship must displace an equivalent mass of seawater. Assuming the density of seawater is approximately:</p>
$$
\text{Density of seawater} = 1,025 \, \text{kg/m}^3
$$

<p>The volume of water displaced \( V \) can then be calculated as:</p>
$$
V = \frac{\text{Mass of ship}}{\text{Density of seawater}} = \frac{200,000,000 \, \text{kg}}{1,025 \, \text{kg/m}^3} \approx 195,122 \, \text{m}^3
$$

<p>Therefore, the ship must displace approximately <strong>195,122 cubic meters</strong> of seawater to remain afloat.</p>

<h2>2. Hypothetical Evacuation Time if Hull is Breached</h2>
<p>Now, let us hypothesize the time available for evacuation if the hull is breached at the stern, near the ballast.</p>

<p>For simplicity, let's assume the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The breach is close to the waterline.</li>
  <li>The breach has an area of \( A = 1 \, \text{m}^2 \).</li>
  <li>The rate of water entering is determined by Torricelli’s theorem: \( v = \sqrt{2gh} \), where:
    <ul>
      <li>\( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approx. \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \))</li>
      <li>\( h \) is the height of the water column above the breach (let’s assume \( h = 5 \, \text{m} \))</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The initial inflow velocity \( v \) is:</p>
$$
v = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 5} \approx 9.9 \, \text{m/s}
$$

<p>Thus, the inflow rate \( Q \) (volume per second) through the breach is:</p>
$$
Q = A \cdot v = 1 \, \text{m}^2 \times 9.9 \, \text{m/s} = 9.9 \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}
$$

<p>Given the total volume that must remain undisturbed to keep the ship afloat is \( 195,122 \, \text{m}^3 \), let’s hypothesize the time \( t \) to reach critical displacement if the rate of flooding remains constant:</p>
$$
t = \frac{195,122 \, \text{m}^3}{9.9 \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}} \approx 19,719 \, \text{s}
$$

<p>Converting to hours:</p>
$$
t \approx \frac{19,719}{3600} \approx 5.5 \, \text{hours}
$$

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This gives approximately <strong>5.5 hours</strong> for evacuation under idealized conditions. In a real scenario, structural factors and safety measures would affect this estimate, but it provides a general idea of the time available in such an emergency.</p>
