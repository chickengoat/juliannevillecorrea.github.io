    <h1>Inception</h1>

    I am guessing many of us generation x people count Inception the movie by Christopher Nolan among our best movies of all time. At its time the story telling was ambitious and expected us to suspend our inhibition and for the duration of the movie follow along hook line and sinker. And boy we did. The premise that our ideas and thoughts are privy to theft, that a thief can search our subconcious minds and make do with our most intimate secrets almost or in fact much more efficiently than leafing through our private journal was sensational. The thief trains thoroughly in order to be good at that, operates in a well knit team
and does a ton of homework. This premise itself had us riveted. 
        Cobb the protagonist with his huge personal demons, his past, his guilt makes for a lead that many of us can relate to. If we were to be granted access to someones dreams and given free hand to play around what would that entail. I am of the opinion that all those who are engaged in creative pursuits do that dont they. We are moved when we consume art arent we. On a primal level it changes us. One can never be the same after one comes face to face with art. Sometimes we shed our prejudice, wash our eyes and heal our wounds. Stealing someones ideas is trivial a job for an amateur but as cobb does inspiring or planting an idea is work for the master, the art of suggestive nudging and persuation the realm of perfect giants.
        Without spoiling the movie i would say that for a person battling within himself or herself Inception has a lot to offer and it does change you.
